# Robot-Walking
To make the robot walks by controlling servo motors, follow this steps: 


### 1.	Counting:

Decide number of servo motors you need. Most walking robots use 6 motors - 2 for each leg.
### 2. Planing:

Put a plan and set sequence of motions, like (lift, swing forward, and place on the ground) in a specific order to keep the robot balanced. 
### 3. Assigning:

Assign each servo motor to the part of the leg or foot it's responsible for.
### 4. Programming:

Write instructions for each motor to control moves and time according to the plan.

### 5. Testing:

Test the walking motion make sure all the motors work together smoothly,and adjust if it's necessary.
